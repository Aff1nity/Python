# Python
As someone who enjoys doing statistical analysis in my free time, I've found that using Python is an excellent way to achieve my goals. Not only is Python a powerful and versatile programming language, but it's also relatively easy to learn and use, even for beginners like myself.

Recently, I've been exploring coding in Python more seriously, with the aim of eventually entering the field of data analysis. While I'm still in the early stages of my coding journey, I've already discovered that there are many resources available to help me learn, including online courses, tutorials, and community forums.

One of the things I like about Python is its simplicity and readability. The syntax is straightforward and easy to understand, which makes it easier for me to write and troubleshoot my code. Additionally, Python has a vast array of libraries and modules available that can be used for statistical analysis and data manipulation, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

As I continue to learn and explore Python, I'm excited about the possibilities that data analysis can offer. From identifying trends and patterns in large data sets to making data-driven decisions, data analysis is a powerful tool that can have a significant impact in a variety of industries.

Overall, my experience with Python has been positive, and I'm eager to continue developing my coding skills as I work towards my goal of entering the field of data analysis. Whether I'm using Python for statistical analysis in my free time or pursuing a career in data analysis, I'm confident that this programming language will continue to be a valuable and versatile tool in my toolkit.

**Projects Overview**

Project Summary: [Amazon Price Tracker](https://github.com/Aff1nity/Python/blob/main/amazon_price_tracker.py)

The Amazon Price Tracker is a Python project that allows users to track the price of a specific product on Amazon and receive an email notification when the product falls below a determined price. This project is designed to help users save money by alerting them when a product they're interested in goes on sale.

The program uses web scraping techniques to extract the price of the product from the Amazon website and compares it to the user's desired price point. If the product falls below the desired price, the program sends an email to the user notifying them of the sale.

This project is a great way for Python beginners to learn about web scraping and email automation. It can also be modified to suit a variety of needs, such as tracking the price of multiple products or setting up recurring price checks.

Project Summary: [Movies Data Analysis](https://github.com/Aff1nity/Python/blob/main/correlation_movies.py)

In this project, a correlation analysis was performed using a movie data set to determine the relationship between a movie's budget and its gross revenue. The aim of the project was to investigate whether there was a correlation between the two variables and, if so, the strength of that correlation.

Based on the results of the correlation analysis, it was found that there was a positive correlation between a movie's budget and its gross revenue. This indicates that there is a relationship between the amount of money spent on a movie's production and the amount of revenue generated from that movie. The strength of the correlation, however, varied depending on the sample of movies and other factors that may affect the movie's success, such as marketing, critical reception, and audience interest.

Project Summary: [Sales Analysis](https://github.com/Aff1nity/Python/blob/main/sales_analysis.ipynb)

In this project, I performed a sales analysis using Python to extract valuable insights from a sales dataset. Using my expertise in data cleaning and analysis, I extracted relevant features such as month, product, city, and hour, and calculated metrics such as total sales and quantity sold.

I then visualized the results using various data visualization techniques, such as bar charts and line plots. From this analysis, I was able to identify the best month for sales, the product with the highest number of sales, the city with the highest number of sales, and the best time to display ads to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying products.

I was then able to streamline the data cleaning and analysis process, and draw actionable insights from the sales data. The results of this analysis can be useful for businesses to improve their sales strategy and make informed decisions.

Project Summary: [Movie Set Creation](https://github.com/Aff1nity/Python/tree/main/Data%20Set%20Creation%20and%20Cleaning)

The code was very valuable for my learning process in data set creation and cleaning using Python. Specifically, the code performs the following functions:

    Scrapes movie data from a web page using Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser.
    Cleans and pre-processes the scraped data using Pandas dataframes, by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.
    Combines the pre-processed data into a final dataset using Pandas, and exports the dataset to a JSON file.

The movie dataset creation code is well-documented, and includes comments explaining each step of the data creation and cleaning process. The skills used in this code, including web scraping, data cleaning, and Pandas data manipulation, are essential and valuable for my learning process.

Overall, this code is an attempt at the creation and cleaning of a data set using Python, and I was able to learn how to extract and transform raw data into a usable dataset for further analysis.

[First Steps](https://github.com/Aff1nity/Python/tree/main/First%20Steps)

The repository showcases my initial attempts at learning and working with Python. It contains a series of Python scripts and sample projects that demonstrate my progress in fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, data types, functions, loops, and conditionals.

Overall, the First Steps repository serves as evidence of my commitment to learning and developing my skills in Python. It demonstrates my growth as a programmer and my willingness to take on new challenges in pursuit of building my knowledge in Python.
