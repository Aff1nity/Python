# Python
As someone who enjoys doing statistical analysis in my free time, I've found that using Python is an excellent way to achieve my goals. Not only is Python a powerful and versatile programming language, but it's also relatively easy to learn and use, even for beginners like myself.

Recently, I've been exploring coding in Python more seriously, with the aim of eventually entering the field of data analysis. While I'm still in the early stages of my coding journey, I've already discovered that there are many resources available to help me learn, including online courses, tutorials, and community forums.

One of the things I like about Python is its simplicity and readability. The syntax is straightforward and easy to understand, which makes it easier for me to write and troubleshoot my code. Additionally, Python has a vast array of libraries and modules available that can be used for statistical analysis and data manipulation, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

As I continue to learn and explore Python, I'm excited about the possibilities that data analysis can offer. From identifying trends and patterns in large data sets to making data-driven decisions, data analysis is a powerful tool that can have a significant impact in a variety of industries.

Overall, my experience with Python has been positive, and I'm eager to continue developing my coding skills as I work towards my goal of entering the field of data analysis. Whether I'm using Python for statistical analysis in my free time or pursuing a career in data analysis, I'm confident that this programming language will continue to be a valuable and versatile tool in my toolkit.

Projects Overview

Project Summary: Amazon Price Tracker [https://github.com/Aff1nity/Python/blob/main/amazon_price_tracker.py]
The Amazon Price Tracker is a Python project that allows users to track the price of a specific product on Amazon and receive an email notification when the product falls below a determined price. This project is designed to help users save money by alerting them when a product they're interested in goes on sale.

The program uses web scraping techniques to extract the price of the product from the Amazon website and compares it to the user's desired price point. If the product falls below the desired price, the program sends an email to the user notifying them of the sale.

This project is a great way for Python beginners to learn about web scraping and email automation. It can also be modified to suit a variety of needs, such as tracking the price of multiple products or setting up recurring price checks.
