# Python
My first steps in python
Hi! It is really nice of you to come here and read my notes.
I have been meaning to dive into Python, data analysis and cloud architecture for a while now and finally I have decided to invest all my free time in developing the necessary skills to achive my goals.
I am originally from Argentina with and Italian citizen ship and I have been living in Sweden for 2 years now.

In this repository you can find my first attempts at creating codes to help me with one of my favorites hobbies: Dungeons and Dragons. Oh, and of course my goal to develop the skills to analyse data correctly.
